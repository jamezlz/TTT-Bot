A basic Discord Bot for playing games of ASCII Tic-Tac-Toe

This is based off of Basic Bot by Habchy#1665 with the added functionality of 
playing Tic-Tac-Toe.

To use this bot follow the instructions in the link above, but
instead of using the basic bot file use TicTacToeBot.py.

Make sure you add your own discord token in the last line.
